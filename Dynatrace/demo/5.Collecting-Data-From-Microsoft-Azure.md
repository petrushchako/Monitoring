# Demo<br>Collecting Data from Microsoft Azure
This demo illustrates how to integrate **Dynatrace with Microsoft Azure** to collect performance metrics using **Azure Monitor**. The integration primarily supports **infrastructure monitoring**, while full-stack monitoring is achievable by installing **Dynatrace OneAgent** on Azure VMs.

<br>

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the integration, you must ensure the following:
- You have **Dynatrace Administrator permissions**.
- You have access to an **ActiveGate** configured for cloud monitoring.
  - The **purpose** of the ActiveGate must be specified during installation.
  - Only relevant modules (e.g., cloud integration) are included based on its purpose.
  - If a module (e.g., for synthetic monitoring) is missing, you'll need to **reinstall** or **deploy a second ActiveGate** with the appropriate configuration.

<br>

### Step-by-Step Integration Process
1. **Verify ActiveGate Module**
   - Go to the **Deployment Status** page.
   - Ensure the Azure module is enabled on your ActiveGate.

2. **Navigate to Azure Integration**
   - Open the **Azure Overview** page in Dynatrace.
   - If no integrations exist, click the **"Set up monitoring"** button.

3. **Configure Azure Monitor Connection**
   - Click the **Connect** button to begin configuration.
   - Provide the following Azure credentials:
     - **Connection name**
     - **Client ID**
     - **Tenant ID**
     - **Secret key**
   - These credentials can be obtained using **Azure CLI** instructions found in the Dynatrace documentation.

4. **Establish the Connection**
   - Once all required fields are populated, click **Connect**.
   - Dynatrace will now integrate with **Azure Monitor** and begin ingesting performance metrics.
