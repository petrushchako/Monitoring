# Demo<br>Collecting Data from Microsoft Azure
This demo illustrates how to integrate **Dynatrace with Microsoft Azure** to collect performance metrics using **Azure Monitor**. The integration primarily supports **infrastructure monitoring**, while full-stack monitoring is achievable by installing **Dynatrace OneAgent** on Azure VMs.

<br>

### Prerequisites
Before setting up the integration, you must ensure the following:
- You have **Dynatrace Administrator permissions**.
- You have access to an **ActiveGate** configured for cloud monitoring.
  - The **purpose** of the ActiveGate must be specified during installation.
  - Only relevant modules (e.g., cloud integration) are included based on its purpose.
  - If a module (e.g., for synthetic monitoring) is missing, you'll need to **reinstall** or **deploy a second ActiveGate** with the appropriate configuration.
