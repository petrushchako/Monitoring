# Demo:<br>Create Browser And HTTP Monitor

### Purpose of Synthetic Monitoring
Synthetic monitoring simulates real user interactions by performing scheduled transactions to detect issues **before** users are impacted. This proactive approach is useful for:
- Verifying transaction performance.
- Testing end-to-end flows.
- Ensuring uptime and availability.

## Steps to Create a Browser Monitor
#### 1. **Navigate to Synthetic Overview**
From Dynatrace UI, go to the **Synthetic Monitoring** overview and click **Create a synthetic monitor**.

#### 2. **Choose Monitor Type**
- Select **Browser Monitor** (uses a real browser).
- Difference from HTTP Monitor:
  - **Browser Monitor**: Simulates full-page and user behavior.
  - **HTTP Monitor**: Sends lightweight HTTP requests.

#### 3. **Define Basic Settings**
- Enter the **URL** to be tested (Dynatrace will validate reachability).
- Prefer `https://` for TLS monitoring.
- Provide a **descriptive monitor name**.
- Add **tags** (optional) for grouping.

#### 4. **Select Device & Network Profile**
- Choose from desktop or mobile devices.
- Define bandwidth constraints for realism (e.g., simulate 3G/4G users).
- Defaults are usually acceptable unless targeting specific user conditions.
