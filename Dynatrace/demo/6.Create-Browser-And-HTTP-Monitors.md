# Demo:<br>Create Browser And HTTP Monitor

### Purpose of Synthetic Monitoring
Synthetic monitoring simulates real user interactions by performing scheduled transactions to detect issues **before** users are impacted. This proactive approach is useful for:
- Verifying transaction performance.
- Testing end-to-end flows.
- Ensuring uptime and availability.

## Steps to Create a Browser Monitor
#### 1. **Navigate to Synthetic Overview**
From Dynatrace UI, go to the **Synthetic Monitoring** overview and click **Create a synthetic monitor**.

#### 2. **Choose Monitor Type**
- Select **Browser Monitor** (uses a real browser).
- Difference from HTTP Monitor:
  - **Browser Monitor**: Simulates full-page and user behavior.
  - **HTTP Monitor**: Sends lightweight HTTP requests.

#### 3. **Define Basic Settings**
- Enter the **URL** to be tested (Dynatrace will validate reachability).
- Prefer `https://` for TLS monitoring.
- Provide a **descriptive monitor name**.
- Add **tags** (optional) for grouping.

#### 4. **Select Device & Network Profile**
- Choose from desktop or mobile devices.
- Define bandwidth constraints for realism (e.g., simulate 3G/4G users).
- Defaults are usually acceptable unless targeting specific user conditions.

### Clickpath Recording Options
#### Manual Configuration
- Add clicks, form inputs, and navigations.
- Suitable for small paths but becomes **tedious** for longer transactions.

#### Using Dynatrace Synthetic Recorder (Chrome Extension)
- Automates clickpath creation.
- Records real interactions using the browser.
- Steps:
  1. Install the **Dynatrace Synthetic Recorder** from Chrome Web Store.
  2. Enable **Incognito Mode** for simulating new user behavior.
  3. Launch the recorder and complete the desired transaction flow within 5 minutes.
  4. Stop recording and review the generated clickpath.

### Scheduling & Geo-Location
- Set **test frequency** (e.g., hourly).
- Choose **multiple locations** (from different cloud providers or user-centric regions) to avoid false positives due to regional outages.
- Monitor cost is based on **user actions per run**, so balance frequency with budget.

<br>

### Finalization
- Review all settings on the Summary screen.
- Click **Create browser monitor**.
- Review performance data, clickpath status, and response times once the monitor is active.
