# Exploring Dynatrace Use Cases
This demo highlights Dynatrace's infrastructure monitoring capabilities by showcasing a real-world scenario: monitoring a .NET microservices application running in Docker containers.

### Environment Overview
- The application is hosted on a GCP instance with Docker and .NET microservices.
- Dynatrace OneAgent is installed on the host, automatically collecting metrics like CPU, memory, network, and logs.

### Navigation and Container Insights
- Access the host from the Smartscape topology or directly via the host overview page.
- Navigate to the **Container Analysis** section to:
  - View the number of running containers (e.g., 20 containers).
  - Analyze group-level metrics such as CPU and memory.
  - View detailed container lists and individual metrics in tabular form.

### Key Observations on Metrics
- Charts initially display **average** CPU and memory usage — a common but potentially misleading metric.
- To detect performance anomalies, change the metric to **90th percentile (P90)**:
  - Example: Average CPU usage showed ~10 mCores, while P90 revealed ~30 mCores.
  - Percentiles offer a more accurate picture of system load during spikes.

### Deep Dive: WebMVC Container
- Navigate to the **Containers** page to access the container groups overview.
- Select the `WebMVC` container group and:
  - Change CPU metric from mCores to percentage using “CPU usage percent of limit.”
  - View additional information: process group, logs, and events.

### Detailed Analysis: Process and Logs
- Drill into the container to the **container overview page**:
  - View performance spikes across CPU, memory, and network charts.
  - Identify correlated metrics, e.g., spike in outbound traffic during CPU surge.
- Drill further into the main process (`WebMVC.dll`) to:
  - Analyze process-level metrics and inter-process communication.
  - Open the **Log Viewer** to examine logs generated during the spike.

### Identifying the Root Cause
- Logs revealed **exceptions and errors** occurring during the time of the CPU spike.
- This indicated failed requests and increased processing, explaining the CPU and network surge.

### Key Takeaways
- Dynatrace enables seamless monitoring from host to container to process and logs.
- All this data is available **out of the box** with a single OneAgent installation.
- No extra configuration is required for logs, metrics, or Docker visibility — simplifying setup and accelerating time to insights.
