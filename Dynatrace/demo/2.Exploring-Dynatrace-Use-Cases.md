# Exploring Dynatrace Use Cases
This demo highlights Dynatrace's infrastructure monitoring capabilities by showcasing a real-world scenario: monitoring a .NET microservices application running in Docker containers.

### Environment Overview
- The application is hosted on a GCP instance with Docker and .NET microservices.
- Dynatrace OneAgent is installed on the host, automatically collecting metrics like CPU, memory, network, and logs.

### Navigation and Container Insights
- Access the host from the Smartscape topology or directly via the host overview page.
- Navigate to the **Container Analysis** section to:
  - View the number of running containers (e.g., 20 containers).
  - Analyze group-level metrics such as CPU and memory.
  - View detailed container lists and individual metrics in tabular form.

### Key Observations on Metrics
- Charts initially display **average** CPU and memory usage â€” a common but potentially misleading metric.
- To detect performance anomalies, change the metric to **90th percentile (P90)**:
  - Example: Average CPU usage showed ~10 mCores, while P90 revealed ~30 mCores.
  - Percentiles offer a more accurate picture of system load during spikes.
