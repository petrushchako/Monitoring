# Demo:<br>Deploy OneAgent
### Objective
This demo walks through installing and configuring **Dynatrace OneAgent** on a **.NET containerized application**. The goal is to enable full observability and performance monitoring by integrating OneAgent into your container environment.

<br>

### Step 1: Navigate to Smartscape
- Go to the **Smartscape topology view** in the Dynatrace dashboard.
- This visual interface shows how services, processes, and hosts interact once data is collected.

<br>

### Step 2: Access the Deployment Page
- Click on **“Deploy Dynatrace”** in the main menu.
- On the deployment screen, click the **“Start Installation”** button.
- Select the platform that matches your environment (e.g., **Linux** for this demo).

<br>

### Step 3: Generate OneAgent Access Token
- You’ll be prompted to **create an access token** that authorizes your system to download and install OneAgent.
- Click **“Create Token”** or go to the **Access Tokens** page to generate a custom one.
- Save the token securely—especially the third segment—as it will not be shown again. Treat it like a password.

<br>

### Step 4: Select CPU Architecture
- Choose the CPU type (e.g., `x86`).
- This ensures you download the correct binary for your environment.

<br>

### Step 5: Optional Configuration Before Download
- **Operation Mode:** Default is **Full Stack Mode** (monitors infrastructure + applications).
- **Log Monitoring:** Enabled by default.
- These can be changed now or later, but for most users, keeping defaults is recommended.

<br>

### Step 6: Download and Install OneAgent
- Copy the **download link** and **installation script** provided.
- SSH into your **Linux container host** and run the commands:

  ```bash
  wget <download_link>
  sudo /bin/sh Dynatrace-OneAgent-Linux.sh
  ```
- Optionally, verify the download with the provided signature check command.

<br>

### Step 7: Restart Application Processes
- After installation, **restart the containerized .NET application** or any other services you want monitored.
- This allows OneAgent to hook into those processes for deep instrumentation.

<br>

### Step 8: Verify Deployment
- Return to the **deployment status** section in the Dynatrace UI.
- Once your host appears, it confirms OneAgent is running and sending telemetry.
- You should begin seeing data in **Smartscape**, showing the relationships and performance metrics for your environment.

<br>

### Summary
By following this process, you:
- Installed OneAgent on a Linux-based container host
- Enabled automatic application and infrastructure monitoring
- Used Dynatrace defaults to simplify setup and maximize data collection
