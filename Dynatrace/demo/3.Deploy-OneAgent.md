# Demo:<br>Deploy OneAgent
### Objective
This demo walks through installing and configuring **Dynatrace OneAgent** on a **.NET containerized application**. The goal is to enable full observability and performance monitoring by integrating OneAgent into your container environment.

<br>

### Step 1: Navigate to Smartscape
- Go to the **Smartscape topology view** in the Dynatrace dashboard.
- This visual interface shows how services, processes, and hosts interact once data is collected.

<br>

### Step 2: Access the Deployment Page
- Click on **“Deploy Dynatrace”** in the main menu.
- On the deployment screen, click the **“Start Installation”** button.
- Select the platform that matches your environment (e.g., **Linux** for this demo).

<br>

### Step 3: Generate OneAgent Access Token
- You’ll be prompted to **create an access token** that authorizes your system to download and install OneAgent.
- Click **“Create Token”** or go to the **Access Tokens** page to generate a custom one.
- Save the token securely—especially the third segment—as it will not be shown again. Treat it like a password.
