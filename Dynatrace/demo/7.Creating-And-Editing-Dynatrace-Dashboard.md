# Demo:<br>Creating and Editing Dynatrace Dashboard
Purpose: build a dashboard by cloning a preset and then create a custom dashboard from scratch for a .NET web application (using the RED method: Rate, Errors, Duration).

<br>

## Solution

### **Step 1 — Open Dashboards overview**
- Log in to Dynatrace and go to **Dashboards** (Dashboard overview page).
- Note: you may see *Dashboards Classic* or the newer UI; steps are equivalent (labels may vary slightly).

<br>

### **Step 2 — Clone an existing (preset) dashboard**
- Locate a preset dashboard (e.g., *Synthetics*, *RUM*, *Kubernetes*).
- Click **Clone** on the dashboard you want to reuse. This copies tiles, queries, and layout so you don’t start from zero.
- Click **Edit** on the cloned dashboard to change name and content. Rename (example): `Synthetic Monitoring - Cape Town`.
- To limit a tile to a specific location:
    - Click the tile you want to change (e.g., *Availability*).
    - Click **Configure** → **Open in Data Explorer** (or equivalent).
    - Add or modify a filter: set **Location = Cape Town** (or the synthetic location you configured).
    - Run the query to validate results, then **Save** the tile configuration.
- When all edits are complete click **Done** (or **Save**) to commit the cloned dashboard.
- Confirm the new cloned dashboard appears in the Dashboards overview.

### **Step 3 — Create a dashboard from scratch**
- Click **Create dashboard** (or **+ New dashboard**).
- Enter a descriptive name, e.g., `Web Application Dashboard` and optionally a description and visibility settings (private / shared).
- You should now see a blank canvas with a tile picker on the right.

<br>

### **Step 4 — Add a visualization tile (stacked area) for Request Rate**
- From tile types choose **Visualization** → **Stacked area** (or similar chart type). Add it to the canvas.
- Click **Configure** to open **Data Explorer** for that tile. In Data Explorer:
    - Search/select the metric for request count (e.g., `request count`, `requests`, or `request.rate`).
    - Group or split by **Service** (so each service becomes a series—useful for microservices architectures).
    - Set time range (default or custom) and run the query to verify results. Adjust aggregation if necessary.
    - Apply any display settings (stacking, legend, smoothing) under chart settings.
  - Save the tile and name it **Request rate**.
