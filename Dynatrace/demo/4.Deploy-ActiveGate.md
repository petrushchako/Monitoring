# Demo:<br>Deploying Active Gate

This section demonstrates the step-by-step process of installing and configuring the **Dynatrace ActiveGate** component on a Linux host, including key tips and best practices for setup.

<br>

### Key Steps in the Installation Process
- Navigate to the **Dynatrace deployment page** and click **“Install ActiveGate.”**
- **Install ActiveGate before OneAgent** if you plan to use both. This allows Dynatrace to **auto-configure OneAgent** to route data through ActiveGate without manual setup.
- Select the **operating system** for ActiveGate. Available platforms include:
  - Windows
  - Linux
  - Kubernetes
- Choose your **CPU architecture** (e.g., x86).
- Create a new **access token** for downloading the ActiveGate binary.
- Define the **purpose of the ActiveGate**:
  - Monitoring and data routing (default)
  - Synthetic testing
  - z/OS mainframe monitoring

  > *Note: If you need to change the purpose later, the process must be restarted.*

<br>

### Deployment Best Practices
- Install ActiveGate on a **dedicated host** to avoid resource contention.
- Download and verify the ActiveGate installer on your host.
- Run the installation command provided in the deployment guide.
- Open necessary network **ports**:
  - ActiveGate listens on **port 9999** for incoming OneAgent and data source connections.
  - Data is forwarded to the Dynatrace Cluster over **port 443**.

<br>

### Post-Installation Verification
- Use the **Dynatrace deployment status page** to:
  - Confirm data is being sent from ActiveGate
  - Check which **ActiveGate modules** are enabled
- If data is not flowing:
  - Ensure port **9999** is open for inbound traffic
  - Verify that the access token and architecture were correctly selected during setup

<br>

### Conclusion
The ActiveGate component is now installed, properly configured, and ready to function as a secure proxy for performance monitoring and routing data in your Dynatrace environment.
