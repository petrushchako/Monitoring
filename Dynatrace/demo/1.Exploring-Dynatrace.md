# Demo:<br>Exploring Dynatrace
This section introduces a guided demo of the Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform, showcasing the core UI components and how they support observability, monitoring, and proactive issue detection.

### Getting Started
To begin using Dynatrace:
- Sign up for a trial through Dynatrace directly (SaaS or Managed) or via the **AWS Marketplace** (pay-as-you-go with a 15-day free trial).
- Upon registration and login, users are directed to the **Deploy Dynatrace** page where initial environment setup begins.

### Smartscape Topology View
**Smartscape** is Dynatrace’s automatic dependency mapping engine that creates a real-time topology of your monitored environment. It provides:

- A clear **stack view** from data center → hosts → processes → services → applications
- Visibility into **inter-service communication**
- The ability to detect gaps or broken dependencies

Unlike competitors that require manual topology configuration, Smartscape builds this view automatically as soon as data starts flowing from OneAgent.

Example capabilities:
- Click a host to view all related services and communication paths
- Drill into host-level metrics such as CPU, memory, and running processes

### Dashboards
The **Dashboards** section provides graphical representations of telemetry data:

- Use **preset dashboards**, **create new dashboards**, or **import existing ones**
- An example is the **OneAgent Traces** dashboard, which shows how effectively trace data is being captured across applications and services

Dashboards help visualize and validate that instrumentation and data collection are working as expected.

### Problem Detection and Alerts
The **Problems** page gives a centralized view of detected issues over a selected time range. Dynatrace applies Davis AI to detect anomalies and performance degradations.

For off-platform alerts:
- **Notifications** can be sent via **email**, or integrated with tools such as **Slack**, **Jira**, and other incident management systems
- Dynatrace also supports a **mobile app** for real-time monitoring and alerts while away from your workstation
