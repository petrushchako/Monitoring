## Splunk Architecture and Licensing Overview
Splunk is designed with a modular and scalable architecture composed of three core components: the **Indexer**, the **Search Head**, and the **Forwarder**. Understanding how these components interact is essential for both using Splunk effectively and succeeding in certification exams.

### Splunk Architecture Components
1. **Indexer**<br>
   The indexer plays a central role in the Splunk architecture. It takes raw machine data—such as logs from Apache web servers—and parses, indexes, and stores them as searchable events. Indexers also handle search requests in distributed environments.
   In a production setup, indexers are responsible for maintaining data availability, performance, and retention policies.
2. **Search Head**<br>
   The search head provides the user interface and handles all search requests. It coordinates with one or more indexers to retrieve relevant results and presents them in a user-friendly way—such as dashboards, reports, and alerts.
   Users interact primarily with the search head during analysis tasks, and it is especially critical in environments with high search concurrency.
3. **Forwarder**<br>
   Forwarders are lightweight Splunk agents installed on source systems. Their job is to collect data and send it to the indexer for further processing.
   There are two types of forwarders:

   * **Universal Forwarder (UF):** Lightweight, efficient, and used for data forwarding only. Ideal for production deployment.
   * **Heavy Forwarder (HF):** Capable of parsing and indexing data before forwarding. Useful when you need to filter or pre-process data at the source.

#### Example Use Case
Consider a scenario where a company wants to analyze web traffic data from multiple Apache servers. Each web server runs a Universal Forwarder that collects log data and forwards it to a centralized Indexer. The Indexer processes and stores this data as searchable events. Analysts or engineers can then use the Search Head to run queries, create dashboards, and generate reports to visualize geographic user distribution, detect anomalies, or troubleshoot issues.

In small-scale development environments, all three components—Indexer, Search Head, and Forwarder—can be installed on a single machine. However, in enterprise deployments, each component is typically deployed on separate servers to ensure scalability and performance.
