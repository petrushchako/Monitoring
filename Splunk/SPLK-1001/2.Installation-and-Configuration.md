## Splunk Architecture and Licensing Overview
Splunk is designed with a modular and scalable architecture composed of three core components: the **Indexer**, the **Search Head**, and the **Forwarder**. Understanding how these components interact is essential for both using Splunk effectively and succeeding in certification exams.

### Splunk Architecture Components
1. **Indexer**<br>
   The indexer plays a central role in the Splunk architecture. It takes raw machine data—such as logs from Apache web servers—and parses, indexes, and stores them as searchable events. Indexers also handle search requests in distributed environments.
   In a production setup, indexers are responsible for maintaining data availability, performance, and retention policies.
2. **Search Head**<br>
   The search head provides the user interface and handles all search requests. It coordinates with one or more indexers to retrieve relevant results and presents them in a user-friendly way—such as dashboards, reports, and alerts.
   Users interact primarily with the search head during analysis tasks, and it is especially critical in environments with high search concurrency.
3. **Forwarder**<br>
   Forwarders are lightweight Splunk agents installed on source systems. Their job is to collect data and send it to the indexer for further processing.
   There are two types of forwarders:

   * **Universal Forwarder (UF):** Lightweight, efficient, and used for data forwarding only. Ideal for production deployment.
   * **Heavy Forwarder (HF):** Capable of parsing and indexing data before forwarding. Useful when you need to filter or pre-process data at the source.

<br>

#### Example Use Case
Consider a scenario where a company wants to analyze web traffic data from multiple Apache servers. Each web server runs a Universal Forwarder that collects log data and forwards it to a centralized Indexer. The Indexer processes and stores this data as searchable events. Analysts or engineers can then use the Search Head to run queries, create dashboards, and generate reports to visualize geographic user distribution, detect anomalies, or troubleshoot issues.

In small-scale development environments, all three components—Indexer, Search Head, and Forwarder—can be installed on a single machine. However, in enterprise deployments, each component is typically deployed on separate servers to ensure scalability and performance.

<br>

### Licensing Model
Splunk's licensing is **primarily based on data ingestion volume**, measured in megabytes (MB) or gigabytes (GB) per day. This approach charges users according to how much data they index, not how much they store or search.

#### Splunk Free License
* Allows indexing of up to **500 MB of data per day**.
* Limited in functionality compared to the enterprise version (e.g., lacks user authentication, alerting features, and distributed search).
* Ideal for learning, development, or small test environments.
* Automatically reverts to the free license when a trial expires unless converted to an enterprise license.

#### Splunk Trial License
* Offers access to **full Splunk Enterprise features** for a limited time (usually 60 days).
* Indexing volume limit can vary (often several GB per day).
* Useful for testing enterprise features such as role-based access control, alerting, clustering, and distributed search.
* Once expired, the trial can either be extended via a sales engagement or reverts to the free license.

#### Splunk Enterprise Licensing
* Intended for production deployments in medium to large organizations.
* Licenses are based on **daily ingestion volume**, with tiers like 1 GB/day, 10 GB/day, 1 TB/day, and beyond.
* Enterprise licenses come in two main forms:
  * **Term license:** Valid for a specific period (e.g., 1-year, 2-year term) and must be renewed.
  * **Perpetual license:** One-time purchase, with optional annual support and upgrades.
* Includes access to full features like clustering, premium apps (e.g., ITSI, ES), authentication methods (LDAP, SAML), and enterprise-level support.

<br>

### Sizing and Best Practices
Correctly sizing a Splunk license is essential to avoid overpayment or data loss due to ingestion caps. Splunk provides tools and best practices to estimate daily ingestion volume. This typically involves:

* Identifying data sources and their average log volume.
* Monitoring trial or pilot deployments.
* Using Splunk’s internal license usage dashboards.

Working with a Splunk sales or solutions engineer is highly recommended to properly estimate your needs and tailor the license plan accordingly.

<br>

### Certification Tip: Architecture and Licensing
For the **Splunk Core Certified User** exam, be prepared to:
- Identify the functions of each core component (Indexer, Search Head, Forwarder).
- Understand basic deployment types: single-instance vs. distributed environments.
- Describe the purpose of the Universal and Heavy Forwarders.
- Understand the impact of ingestion volume on licensing.
- Know the limitations of the free and trial licenses.

Being able to conceptualize a basic Splunk architecture and explain how data flows from source to indexed events to user queries is a foundational skill, both for the exam and for real-world usage.
