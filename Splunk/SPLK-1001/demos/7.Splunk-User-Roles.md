# Splunk User Roles
This demo walks through how to manage **roles** and **users** in the Splunk Web interface, focusing on understanding default roles (admin, power, user), their **capabilities**, and how to assign them to users.

<br>

### Accessing Roles and Users
1. **Login** to Splunk Web
2. From the **Main Dashboard**, go to:
   * `Settings` â†’ `Users and Authentication`
     * Select **Roles** to manage role capabilities
     * Select **Users** to create or manage user accounts

<br>

### Exploring Default Roles
Splunk includes three key default roles:
| Role      | Description                                                                        |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **User**  | Basic search permissions, can manage their own searches and dashboards             |
| **Power** | Inherits User capabilities plus can create/manage shared alerts, knowledge objects |
| **Admin** | Full access, including system settings, user and role management                   |

There are also additional system roles, but the focus here is on these core three.

### Admin Role Deep Dive
* **Inheritance**: Admin role inherits capabilities from both **Power** and **User** roles.
  * Example: Admin shows **39 inherited capabilities**, drawn from the roles it inherits.
* **Capabilities**: Define what actions a role can perform.
  * These can be viewed and customized.
  * Use Splunk **documentation** to understand specific capabilities (e.g., `edit_health`, which allows managing system health alerts).

You can:
* **Create new roles** with selected capabilities
* **Modify inheritance** to reuse role definitions
* Customize to match **team responsibilities** or **least privilege principles**

<br>

### Creating and Managing Users
In the **Users** tab:
* View existing users
* Create new users with:
  * **Username**
  * **Email**
  * **Password** (minimum 8 characters)
  * **Time zone**
  * **Assigned role(s)** (can be one or multiple)
  * Option: Require password change at first login

When adding a new user:
1. Choose the appropriate **role** (e.g., admin, user, or custom)
2. Assign it based on what the user needs access to
3. Save the user profile

<br>

### Best Practices
* **Roles define permissions**, not users directly
* Use **custom roles** for fine-grained access control
* Limit admin access to trusted users only
* Refer to the [Splunk Role Capabilities Documentation](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Admin/ListofSplunkusercapabilities) when configuring permissions

<br>

### Summary of Key Concepts
* Roles control **permissions** and **data access**
* Users are assigned roles during creation
* Splunk provides **default roles** but supports **custom roles**
* **Capabilities** can be viewed, modified, and inherited
* The admin role is the most powerful and inherits from others
* User creation is straightforward, with the main consideration being **role assignment**
