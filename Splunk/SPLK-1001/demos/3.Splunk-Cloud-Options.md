# Splunk Cloud Options
### Two Deployment Options for Cloud-Based Splunk

|**Option**|**Description**|
|----------|---------------|
|**Splunk Cloud (SaaS)**|Fully-managed trial version of Splunk. Hosted by Splunk.|
|**Splunk Enterprise on AWS**|Self-hosted Splunk Enterprise running in AWS EC2 using an AMI.|

<br>

### Option 1: Splunk Cloud Trial (SaaS)
* **15-day trial** with **5 GB/day ingest limit**
* No infrastructure setup required
* Initiation steps:
  1. Click **Start Trial** in the Splunk interface.
  2. Splunk provisions your cloud instance (approx. 10 minutes).
  3. Access your trial instance via the emailed link.

> **Important**: Trial duration starts immediately after activation.

### Option 2: Run Splunk in AWS (Self-Managed)
* Use **AWS EC2** and launch a **Splunk Enterprise AMI** from the AWS Marketplace
* Setup is similar to previous on-prem Linux/Windows installs
* Key details:
  * Matches the version used in your manual installs
  * Requires a **BYOL** (Bring Your Own License) model
  * Can utilize AWS Free Tier depending on configuration
* Great option to:
  * Pair with your existing POC setup
  * Mimic real-world cloud deployment scenarios
  * Practice deployment and administration skills

> This is not the same as Splunk Cloud (SaaS)â€”you are responsible for managing and maintaining the instance.

### Summary of What Was Covered
* **Two paths for cloud-based POCs**:
  * Fully managed Splunk Cloud trial
  * Self-managed Splunk Enterprise on AWS
* Flexibility to explore both SaaS and IaaS approaches
