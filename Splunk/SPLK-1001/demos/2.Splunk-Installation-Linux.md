# Installing Splunk Enterprise on Linux (Development POC)

This guide outlines how to install **Splunk Enterprise** on a **CentOS Linux** machine as part of a **proof of concept (POC)** for **development only**, not production.

<br>

### Prerequisites

* A **Splunk account** with access to [Free Trials & Downloads](https://www.splunk.com)
* A **Linux VM** (CentOS used in this example)
* Internet access and **wget** installed
* SELinux set to permissive
* Port `8000` open in firewall or VM settings

<br>

### System Requirements

* OS: CentOS, RHEL, Ubuntu, Debian, or other supported Linux distros
* Packages available:

  * `.rpm` (Red Hat/CentOS)
  * `.deb` (Debian/Ubuntu)
  * `.tgz` (Generic Unix install)
* For POC, CentOS with `.rpm` was chosen
* Bookmark the [official documentation](https://docs.splunk.com) for version-specific requirements

<br>

### Downloading with `wget`

1. Go to **Splunk Enterprise** under Free Trials & Downloads
2. Select the **Linux .rpm** option
3. Instead of manual download, copy the **wget command** shown for CLI install
4. On your CentOS VM:

   ```bash
   yum install wget -y       # Ensure wget is installed
   wget <copied_url>         # Download Splunk Enterprise .rpm package
   ```

<br>

### SELinux & Environment Prep

1. Check SELinux status:

   ```bash
   sestatus
   ```
2. If it's `enforcing`, temporarily set it to `permissive`:

   ```bash
   setenforce 0
   sestatus   # Confirm it now shows permissive
   ```

<br>

### Installing Splunk RPM

1. Make the `.rpm` file executable:

   ```bash
   chmod 744 splunk*.rpm
   ```
2. Install the package:

   ```bash
   rpm -i splunk*.rpm
   ```

<br>

### Start and Configure Splunk

1. Start Splunk:

   ```bash
   /opt/splunk/bin/splunk start --accept-license
   ```
2. Set admin credentials (username and an 8+ character password)
3. Splunk will confirm the web interface is ready at:

   ```
   http://<your-ip>:8000
   ```

<br>

### Access Splunk Web

* Open your browser and go to:

  ```
  http://localhost:8000
  ```

  *(Replace `localhost` with your VM's IP if remote)*
* Log in using the **admin credentials** you just set
* Skip the tour and go to **Search & Reporting**

### Troubleshooting Tips

| Issue                      | Solution                                                          |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Can’t access web interface | Check firewall/VM network settings and ensure port `8000` is open |
| SELinux blocking services  | Make sure it’s set to `permissive` during install                 |
| Login fails                | Double-check your admin username/password                         |
| DNS issues on VM           | Use IP instead of hostname when accessing Splunk Web              |

### Summary
You now have Splunk installed in a **Linux dev environment**. It's ready for ingesting data and beginning analysis. Whether it's on Windows, Linux, or Cloud, the next step is learning how to **bring data into Splunk**.
