# Uploading and Searching Data in Splunk

### Getting Started with Hands-On Data
Now that Splunk is set up, it's time to upload sample data used throughout the course. This gives you real events to search and visualize within the platform.

<br>

### Navigating the Splunk Interface
**Two main paths to add data:**
1. **From the main dashboard**: Use the **Add Data** button.
2. **From Settings**: Navigate to `Settings > DATA` for options like:
   - Data Inputs
   - Forwarding and Receiving
   - Indexes
   - Source Types
   - Ingest Type

<br>

### Choosing the Ingestion Method
At the bottom of the **Add Data** interface, three options are available:
- **Upload**: Manually upload files (used in this section).
- **Monitor**: Watch local files/directories for updates.
- **Forward**: Collect data from external forwarders.

This module focuses on uploading a set of access logs from *Globomantics*.

<br>

### Uploading Access Logs
- Select the **Upload** option.
- Use the course files provided (about 4,000 access log events).
- These contain:
  - Client IP addresses
  - Timestamps
  - URLs accessed

<br>

### Configuring Upload Settings
Splunk will try to auto-detect:
- **Source type** (e.g., `access_combined_with_cookie`)
- **Timestamp format**
- **Event breaking rules**

You can manually override or customize:
- Source type
- Regular expression patterns
- Time extraction
- File type recognition

<br>

### Creating an Index
- Choose input settings.
- Change the **Index** to a new custom index: `pluralsight`
- This index keeps all development course data organized.

> Note: In larger environments, Splunk allows configuring `Home`, `Cold`, and `Thawed` paths for advanced data storage management.

<br>

### Submitting and Reviewing
- Submit the data.
- Navigate to the **Search & Reporting** interface.
- Search behavior is similar to SQL-based tools.

Set the time range to **All time** to include static uploaded logs.

<br>

### Exploring the Uploaded Data
- View events by:
  - `sourcetype`
  - `index`
  - `hostname`
  - `source` (file name)

You can:
- Filter events by IP address
- Count events per IP
- Visualize **Top Values by Time**

<pre>
Example: Chart showing most active client IPs by hour—created in under 5 seconds.
</pre>

<br>

### Additional Tips
- Searching by specific fields (like IP addresses) helps quickly drill down into activity.
- This interface supports more advanced filters, analytics, and visualizations in future lessons.

<br>

### Milestone
You’ve now:
- Successfully uploaded your first dataset
- Explored Splunk’s search UI
- Performed basic filtering and visualization

This foundational setup prepares you for more advanced features like dashboards, alerts, and reports.
