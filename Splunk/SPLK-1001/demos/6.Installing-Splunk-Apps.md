# Installing Splunk Apps

### What is Splunkbase?
**Splunkbase** is an official repository of apps and add-ons created by:
* **Splunk** themselves
* **Technology partners** (e.g., Dell)
* **Community contributors**

These apps can enhance your Splunk setup by:
* Adding integrations (e.g., with Isilon, AWS, databases)
* Providing advanced visualizations
* Enabling domain-specific use cases (e.g., security, IT ops)
* Introducing machine learning features

<br>

### Accessing Splunkbase from Within Splunk
1. **Navigate to the Splunk Console**
   * From your default **Splunk Dashboard**, look to the **left-hand menu**.

2. **Click “Find More Apps”**
   * This will connect you to **Splunkbase** from inside your instance.
   * This in-console access mirrors the functionality of browsing Splunkbase online.

3. **Search for Desired Apps**
   * Example 1: Search for `Isilon` to find Dell’s **Isilon Cluster App**.
   * Example 2: Search for `Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit` to find ML capabilities.

<br>

### Installing an App (e.g., Machine Learning Toolkit)
1. **Click “Install”** on the app of interest.
2. **Authenticate with Your Splunk.com Account**
   * This is **not** your Splunk admin account for the local instance.
   * Use your **Splunk.com credentials** to authorize the download.
3. **Wait for Installation to Complete**
   * After a few moments, the new app appears in the **left-hand sidebar** of your dashboard.

<br>

### Post-Installation Example: Machine Learning Toolkit
Once installed, the **Splunk Machine Learning Toolkit (MLTK)** allows you to:
* Detect **outliers**
* Forecast **time series data**
* Perform **clustering** and **regression** tasks
* Use **prebuilt models** and **guided assistants**

> Note: This course does not go into detail about machine learning functionality, but installing the app now sets you up for future learning.

<br>

### Additional Notes
* You can **install multiple apps** from Splunkbase directly in the console.
* You can also **create your own apps** and upload them to Splunkbase for others to use.
* Apps can be installed offline too, by downloading `.spl` files from the web and uploading them manually.

<br>

### Summary
Splunkbase apps can significantly boost your Splunk experience. You’ve now learned how to:
* Access Splunkbase from within the Splunk UI
* Search and install apps like **Isilon Cluster App** and **ML Toolkit**
* Authenticate using a Splunk.com account
* Begin exploring advanced toolsets, like machine learning, for future use
