## Bucket Management

### Splunk Admin View: Index Configuration
In this demo, we explore how to manage index settings and bucket storage tiers directly from the **Splunk admin dashboard**.

### Accessing Index Settings
* Navigate to: **Settings → Indexes**
* Example used: `dev_web` index from the Globomantics development environment (stores access logs).

### Key Paths in Index Configuration
Each index includes configuration paths for different data storage tiers:
* **Home Path**:
  Location for **hot and warm buckets** (active or recently used data).
* **Cold Path**:
  Used for **cold buckets**, typically on slower or cheaper storage media.
* **Thawed Path**:
  Where data is restored to from archives when needed for reanalysis.

These paths can be customized to match your environment's **performance** and **storage cost** requirements.

### Bucket Types: Overview
Splunk breaks down indexed data into **bucket types** based on data age and access frequency:
1. **Hot Bucket**:
   Actively written to; high performance.
2. **Warm Bucket**:
   Recently closed; still searchable.
3. **Cold Bucket**:
   Older data; moved to cheaper storage.
4. **Thawed Bucket**:
   Archived data that's been restored for search.

> You can adjust **storage limits** for each bucket type based on ingest rate and retention policies.

### Planning Considerations
* Bucket size limits are **based on storage volume**, not on strict time frames (e.g., 24 hours or 1 week).
* Ingest rate determines how quickly a bucket fills.
* Collaboration with the infrastructure team is essential to:
  * Define storage requirements for each tier.
  * Ensure high performance for **hot paths**.
  * Control costs for **cold paths**.

### Capacity Planning and Licensing
* Knowing your **daily ingest rate** is critical (e.g., 1 TB/day).
* Growth in data volume (e.g., new applications pushing to 2 TB/day) impacts:
  * **Storage requirements**
  * **Bucket configuration**
  * **Splunk license costs**

> Bucket configuration plays a vital role in **search performance**, **cost control**, and **scalability planning**.
