# Adding More Data into Splunk

This section walks through a bonus exercise where we explore **monitoring** real-time data from your local machine using Splunk. This hands-on activity gives you additional data to practice with and builds familiarity with the search experience.

### Step-by-Step: Adding Local Windows Event Logs

1. **Go to the Splunk Dashboard**
   * From your main Splunk interface, navigate to **Add Data**.

2. **Choose the Monitor Option**
   * Instead of uploading a static file, this time we select **Monitor** to pull live system data.

3. **Select Local Event Logs**
   * Since we’re using a Windows machine, choose **Local Event Logs** from the available sources.
   * Select **all the listed logs** to ingest a broad set of system event data.

4. **Assign Index and Host**
   * Use an existing index for consistency. In this case, it’s set to:
     * **Index**: `pluralsight`
     * **Host**: `thenson-desktop` (or your machine’s name)

5. **Submit the Configuration**
   * Click **Next** and then **Submit** to start ingesting the Windows event logs.

### Exploring the Data in Splunk Search
Once the logs are ingested, Splunk begins indexing the incoming data. You can now search and visualize it in real time.

#### Example Search Fields:
* `sourcetype="WinEventLog:*"`
* `host="thenson-desktop"`
* `index="pluralsight"`

#### Real-Time Monitoring Features:
* **Time-based Filtering**
  You can select time ranges such as **Last 15 minutes**, **Last 4 hours**, or **All time** to refine your searches.
* **Live Event Feed**
  As Windows events continue to occur (like logins, logouts, or errors), Splunk updates the event feed in real time.

### Use Cases for This Data

1. **Security Event Codes**
   * You’ll see logs such as `EventCode=4624` for successful logins.
   * Filter by `EventCode` to isolate interesting activity.

2. **Account Domain Names**
   * Useful for understanding which user accounts or systems are generating activity.

3. **Host-Based Activity**
   * Since you’re pulling from a single machine, all data will show your machine name as the host.

### Visualization and Reporting
As more data accumulates:
* You can **build charts** and **generate reports** on the top events over time.
* Dashboards can show:
  * Most common event types
  * Frequent users or accounts
  * Peaks in activity over time

### Summary
This exercise sets up continuous data ingestion using the **monitoring** feature and introduces **real-time analysis** of system logs. It helps reinforce the concepts of:
* Indexing and host assignment
* Real-time vs historical searches
* SPL queries using event codes and fields
* Visualizing trends and outliers
